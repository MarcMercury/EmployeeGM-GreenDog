I grew up surrounded by German shepherds. Later, for family dogs, I appreciated a soulful Rhodesian ridgeback and a beagle who was quite an escape artist; and still later a 120-pound American bulldog named Patch. Although I haven't owned a dog in long time, I remain a dog lover.

I once wrote an article published by Dog World magazine titled: ""Separate Breeds or Variation Within a Breed?""

My BA degree is in anthropology. Later in life, I earned a MA in economics, to better understand man and politics. My great interest lies in science and philosophy; my hobby is artistic creation, art for art's sake.

I'm very capable and I learn quickly. I'm also mature and reliable and personable. And I live nearby in Santa Monica, right on Main Street, just a few blocks from your location.
